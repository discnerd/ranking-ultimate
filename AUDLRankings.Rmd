```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)

```



```{r pullTeams}
teams <-read_html("http://theaudl.com/teams")
team_names <- teams %>% html_nodes("h3+ h3 a:nth-child(1)") %>% html_text()
team_links <- teams %>% html_nodes("h3+ h3 a:nth-child(1)") %>% html_attr("href")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
